Example schedule of two tasks $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ on two processors sharing one lock-protected resource. The example assumes that lock requests take effect only when the critical section segment  becomes eligible to be scheduled according to the rules of the period enforcer algorithm. Under this interpretation, the fourth job of task $\tau_2$ misses its deadline at time $28$.
