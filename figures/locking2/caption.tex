Example schedule of two tasks $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ on two processors sharing one lock-protected resource. The example assumes that lock requests take effect immediately, even if the critical section segment is not yet eligible to be scheduled according to the rules of the period enforcer algorithm. Under this interpretation, the third job of task $\tau_1$ misses its deadline at time $24$.
